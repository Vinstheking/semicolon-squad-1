            Milk should find a place in any balanced diet, particularly in a
            vegetarian diet, to provide some good quality protein, sufficient
            calcium and riboflavin which are difficult to obtain in adequate
            quantities solely from plant foods. The National Institute of
            Nutrition has recommended a minimum of 300g daily intake of milk for
            children between 1-3 years of age and 250g for those between 10-12
            years.

            Higher calorie milks are more suitable for those who have increased
            energy requirements e.g. children and adolescents, or those with
            poor appetites who need nutrient dense foods to provide as many
            calories as possible in small amounts e.g. the elderly. Lower
            calorie milks are suitable for the majority of the population and
            are especially useful when consumed as part of a calorie controlled
            diet for contributing to weight loss
